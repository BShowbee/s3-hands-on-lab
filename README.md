# Introduction to Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

This hands-on lab will take you on a journey to start learning Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3. Amazon S3 runs on the worldâ€™s largest global cloud infrastructure, and is designed from the ground up to deliver 99.999999999% of durability.
